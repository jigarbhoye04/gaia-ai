  <Step title="Fork & Clone">
    Fork the repository on GitHub and clone your fork locally:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gaia.git
    cd gaia
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/heygaia/gaia.git
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Branch">
    Create a new branch for your feature or fix:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    # or
    git checkout -b fix/bug-description
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make Changes">
    Make your changes following our coding standards and best practices.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Your Changes">
    Run the test suite to ensure your changes don't break anything:

    ```bash
    # Backend tests
    cd backend && uv run pytest

    # Frontend tests
    cd frontend && pnpm test

    # Linting
    cd backend && uvx ruff check
    cd frontend && pnpm lint
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Commit & Push">
    Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: add new AI capability for task management"
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Pull Request">
    Open a pull request on GitHub with a clear description of your changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Coding Standards

### Python Backend

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="python" title="Code Style">
    - Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python code style
    - Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
    - Include comprehensive docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions
    - Run `uvx ruff check` before committing to ensure code quality
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="code" title="Architecture Patterns">
    **Route Handlers** should be thin wrappers:
    ```python
    @router.post("/resource", response_model=ResourceResponse)
    async def create_resource_endpoint(
        resource: ResourceModel,
        user: dict = Depends(get_current_user)
    ):
        """Create a new resource."""
        return await create_resource(resource, user["user_id"])
    ```

    **Service Functions** contain business logic:
    ```python
    async def create_resource(resource: ResourceModel, user_id: str) -> ResourceResponse:
        """Create a new resource in the database."""
        # Implementation here
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Frontend (Next.js/React)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="react" title="Component Standards">
    - Use TypeScript for all components
    - Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
    - Use Tailwind CSS for styling
    - Implement proper error boundaries
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="folder" title="File Organization">
    ```
    src/
    ├── components/       # Reusable UI components
    ├── features/        # Feature-specific components
    ├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks
    ├── lib/             # Utility functions
    ├── services/        # API service functions
    └── types/           # TypeScript type definitions
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
