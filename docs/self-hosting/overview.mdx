## Welcome to GAIA Self-Hosting

GAIA (General Purpose AI Assistant) can be easily self-hosted on your own infrastructure using Docker Compose. This gives you complete control over your data and allows you to customize the deployment to your specific needs.

## Architecture Overview

GAIA consists of several components that work together:

- **Frontend**: Next.js React application
- **Backend**: FastAPI Python application
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB for embeddings
- **Cache**: Redis for caching and sessions
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for task processing
- **Document Storage**: MongoDB for document metadata

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
